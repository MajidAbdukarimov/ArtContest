- **Hash:** 31e35c80fc

### Installation Process
```bash
# Repository cloning
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git

# Model download (6.5GB)
wget https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/resolve/main/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors

# Launch with optimizations for hardware compatibility
python launch.py --share --no-half --no-half-vae --disable-opt-split-attention --medvram
```

### Hardware Compatibility Challenges
During implementation, several technical challenges were encountered:

**GPU Limitations:**
- Compute capability 7.5 vs required 8.0+ for optimal performance
- xFormers compatibility issues with CUDA versions
- Memory optimization required (--medvram flag)

**Resolution Applied:**
- Disabled half-precision processing (--no-half, --no-half-vae)
- Used medium VRAM optimization (--medvram)
- Disabled problematic attention optimizations
- Successfully loaded SDXL model in 13.2 seconds

Negative prompt: text, watermark, low quality, blurry, people, faces
```

#### Book Cover - 1984 Redesign:
```
book cover design, dystopian surveillance theme, "1984" typography, 
modern surveillance cameras, digital eye patterns, dark atmospheric mood, 
george orwell style, professional book design, clean layout, 
contemporary interpretation of big brother watching

Negative prompt: cluttered design, illegible text, poor composition, bright colors
```

#### Movie Poster - Blade Runner Redesign:
```
